# Immediate Response Sounds

This directory should contain immediate response sounds that Polly will play
when the button is pressed, before recording starts.

Files should be named with the format `immediate_NAME.wav`, where NAME is a
descriptive name for the response.

Example files:
- `immediate_thinking.wav` - "Let me think about that..."
- `immediate_listening.wav` - "I'm listening..."
- `immediate_processing.wav` - "Processing your question..."

You can create these files using text-to-speech services or record them yourself.
