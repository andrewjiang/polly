# **Product Requirements Document (PRD) ‚Äì Polly the ChatGPT-Powered Talking Bird**

## **1. Product Overview**
Polly is a stuffed bird with an embedded Raspberry Pi 4 that enables natural voice interaction for children. It listens, responds intelligently using ChatGPT, and provides an engaging, interactive experience. Polly is activated via a hidden push button in its wing and records speech until 2 seconds of silence. It then sends the recorded speech to a connected smartphone via Wi-Fi, where the phone processes the audio, generates a ChatGPT-powered response, and sends back Polly's reply using text-to-speech.

## **2. Key Features & Functional Requirements**
### **Core Features (MVP)**
‚úÖ **Embedded Electronics:** Electronics are housed in a removable module for easy maintenance.  
‚úÖ **Voice Activation:** Push button inside the wing activates Polly. Future versions may add a wake word.  
‚úÖ **Speech Processing:**
   - Polly records audio until 2 seconds of silence.
   - Background noise filtering ensures clear speech capture.
‚úÖ **ChatGPT Integration:**  
   - Polly connects to a smartphone via Wi-Fi hotspot and sends recorded audio.  
   - The phone's web app transcribes the audio using OpenAI Whisper.  
   - The transcribed text is sent to ChatGPT to generate a response.  
   - The response is converted to speech using AWS Polly / Google TTS.  
‚úÖ **Text-to-Speech Response:**  
   - The response is played back via Polly's **USB-powered mini speaker**.  
   - A simple immediate audio response plays on the Pi for responsiveness while waiting for the full response.
‚úÖ **Randomized Responses:** Polly introduces variation in its responses to feel more natural.  
‚úÖ **Uncertainty Handling:** If Polly doesn't understand, it says: *"I'm not sure, can you ask again?"* with random variations.  
‚úÖ **Basic Power Management:** Polly enters sleep mode when inactive, waking only when the button is pressed.  

### **"Nice-to-Haves" (Future Enhancements)**
‚≠ê **Wake Word Activation (e.g., "Hey Polly")** instead of button press.  
‚≠ê **Offline Mode with Preloaded Responses** for times when Polly has no internet connection.  
‚≠ê **Low Battery Alert** ("I'm feeling sleepy, charge me soon!").  
‚≠ê **Facial Expressions or LED Indicator** to show listening/thinking status.  
‚≠ê **Customizable Personality Modes** (e.g., funny Polly, serious Polly, storytelling mode).

## **5. User Flow (Updated for Web App)**
1. **User presses the button (hidden in Polly's wing, connected to GPIO 17).**  
2. **Polly starts listening and records the child's speech.**  
   - Polly stops recording when it detects 2 seconds of silence.  
   - **Audio is captured via the 3.5mm microphone connected to the USB sound card.**
   - Background noise is filtered for clarity.  
   - Polly plays a simple immediate response for responsiveness.
3. **Polly sends the recording to a connected phone via Wi-Fi hotspot.**  
   - The phone web app transcribes the audio using OpenAI Whisper.  
   - The transcribed text is sent to ChatGPT to generate a response.  
   - The response is converted to speech using AWS Polly / Google TTS.  
4. **The phone sends the synthesized audio back to Polly.**  
5. **Polly plays the response using its USB-powered speaker.**  
6. **Polly goes into sleep mode until the button is pressed again.**

## **üîÑ Next Steps (Updated)**
1. **Set up Raspberry Pi OS** on the included microSD card.  
2. **Configure USB sound adapter** to recognize both the **3.5mm microphone and USB speaker.**  
3. **Test push button integration on GPIO 17.**  
4. **Write & test Python scripts** for:
   - Button press detection
   - Audio capture from **3.5mm mic via USB sound card**
   - Audio playback through **USB speaker**
   - Sending/receiving messages via web app interface
5. **Develop a simple web app** for iPhone to process audio and generate responses.
6. **Assemble Polly**: Secure the microphone, speaker, and button inside the stuffed toy.  
7. **Test full interaction loop** (press button ‚Üí record ‚Üí process via web app ‚Üí speak response).
